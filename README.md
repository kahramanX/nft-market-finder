## What does "NFT Market Finder" do?

"NFT Market Finder" shows which marketplaces an NFT with contract and token ID is listed on. It only performs this search on marketplaces that are already registered with the system and are eligible for search. Whichever network the registered NFT marketplaces support, "NFT Market Finder" can also search in that network.
